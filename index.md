## Hi, I'm Ana!

<img class="profile-picture" src="ana.png">

I am Ana Veroneze Solórzano, a researcher and computer scientist. I am currently a PhD Candidate in Computer Engineering at Northeastern University in Boston, advised by Prof. [Devesh Tiwari](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/tiwari-devesh/). I am researching on the societal impact of HPC, encompassing sustainability, data privacy and sharing, and equitable access to these systems. Before that, I worked with distributed deep learning and parallel computing. My goal is to use my experience in programming, performance analysis, visualization, and diverse HPC systems to make a positive impact on society.

## Interests

High-Performance Computing | Sustainable HPC | Data Privacy

## Education

- Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Engineering, Northeastern University
- M.S. in Computer Science, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil
- BSc in Computer Science, Federal University of Santa Maria, Brazil
