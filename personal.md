# Personal

Besides work, I enjoy reading self-development and dystopian books (my favorite is Brave New World), watching movies ([podcast ep.](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0U3Etjb1JtpbvyEd84UTBk?si=7f97abf0a76f4f97) on one of my favorite movies), and exercising. Going to concerts is my favorite hobby - [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6LzNBaB0ntsGb2hQvH674o?si=369c089afcc147b5) with bands I saw since I moved to the USA.

I enjoy writing about [experiences](https://medium.com/@anaveroneze/list/experiences-3511152bb949), [travel itineraries](https://medium.com/@anaveroneze/list/travel-e29da5b7d070), and pt-br learnings from being a [grad student](https://medium.com/@anaveroneze/list/posgraduacao-f61b957b08b9). I use [Medium](https://medium.com/@anaveroneze) and have published at [Revelo](https://community.revelo.com.br/author/anaveroneze/). 
 
I speak Portuguese (native), English (inevitable), Spanish (by osmosis from my Peruvian dad), and some French (in-progress).
