## Darshan-LDMS Integrator:

- A framework that integrates Darshan (I/O application monitoring) and LDMS (system monitoring) to provide low-latency monitoring of distributed applications running in large-scale systems during runtime.
- Officially deployed in [Darshan 3.4.5](https://wordpress.cels.anl.gov/darshan/2024/05/03/darshan-3-4-5-now-available/).
- I created a [Jupyter notebook tutorial](https://github.com/GoodwillComputingLabs/Darshan-LDMS-Analyzer/blob/main/ldms-darshan-ldmscon2024.ipynb) to help you start using this tool locally or in a [AWS Cloud instance](https://github.com/anaveroneze/ldms-darshan-analysis/blob/main/code/aws_configuring.ipynb).
- *Skills: Python, Darshan, LDMS, I/O, performance analysis.*
